# Number Systems

**Number**- abstract entity representing a count
**Components of number systems**:
- symbols
- rules of representation
- rules of operations
**Types of number systems**:
- Positional
	- Value of symbol derived from position
- Non-positional
	- Value of symbol is same regardless of position


## Positional number system

A non-negative number in a weighted positional number system is represented as:
$$
\begin{flalign}
	&(A)_R=(a_{n-1}...a_0*a_{-1}...a{-M})_R=(I_A*F_A)=(I)_R*(F)_R\\
	&R\text{ is an integer base of the system }\textit{(radix)},R\gt1\\
	a_i\text{ is a digit at }i\text{-th position},a_i\in\set{0,1,...,R-1}\\
\end{flalign}
$$
