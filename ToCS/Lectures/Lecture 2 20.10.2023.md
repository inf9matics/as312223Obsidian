# Recursive algorithms
Recursive algorithms should be:
- short (efficient code)
- incorporated carefully (halting)

# Serial and parallel algorithms
## Serial execution
Serial execution is an algorithm that's executed sequentially

## Parallel execution
Multiple algorithms run in parallel

# Efficiency
## Types of efficiency
- execution is faster
- requires less memory

## Complexity
Due to varying inputs, we distuingish
- optimistic efficiency
- pessimistic efficiency
- average efficiency

## Big-O Notation
Big-O Notation is the time complexity of an algorithm.
You can distinguish different cases:
- Standard
- Optimistic
- Pessimistic
