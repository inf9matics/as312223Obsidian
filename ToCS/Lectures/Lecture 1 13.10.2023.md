# Algorithms
## Definition
- A set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations for solving a class of problems
## Features of an algorithm
- generality
- finiteness
- definiteness
- complexity

# Pseudocode
- Naming convention: `type_of_data name_of_variable = value`
- Basic data types:
	- `bool`
	- `char`
	- `int`
	- `float`
	- `array`
		- `array[n]`
