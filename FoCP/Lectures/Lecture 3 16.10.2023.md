# Functions
## Defining a function
```
return_type function_name (args) {
	instructions

	return x
}
```

## Difference between declaring arguments
- When declaring an argument as such `(type name)`, the variable will not be changed
- When declaring an argument as such `(type &name)`, the variable will be changed from inside the function (it's referenced directly)

# Switch statement
## Definition
```
switch(int variable)
case(a) {
	instructions
}
case(b) {
	instructions
}
case(c) {
	instructions
}
```
