# Basic method
## Laws used
- KVL
- KCL
- Ohm's Law

## Steps
1. Variables
	1. Write out all possible unknown variables in a circuit, while assigning them directions
2. Equations
	1. Write out as many independent equations as there are variables
		1. KCL equations:
		    n = number of nodes
		    KCL<sub>equations</sub> = n-1
		2. KVL equations:
		   k = number of voltage loops
		   KVL<sub>equations</sub> = k-1
3. Solve acquired linear equations
